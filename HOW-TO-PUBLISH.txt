MDM DESIGN STUDIO — BLOG REVIEW PORTAL
How to Publish & Share with Your Client
========================================

WHAT'S IN THIS ZIP
------------------
  index.html          → Dashboard (the main page your client sees first)
  style.css           → Shared styles
  app.js              → Shared logic (approvals, storage, export)
  posts/
    post-01.html      → Post 1: From Sketch to Sawdust
    post-02.html      → Post 2: Why the First Measurement Matters Most
    ... (all 25 posts)

PUBLISHING IN 60 SECONDS — NETLIFY DROP (FREE)
-----------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop
   (No account required for basic hosting)

2. UNZIP the folder "mdm-review-portal" on your computer first.

3. Drag the UNZIPPED "mdm-review-portal" FOLDER onto the Netlify Drop page.
   !! Important: Drag the folder itself, not the zip file. !!

4. Netlify generates a live URL instantly — something like:
   https://quirky-name-12345.netlify.app

5. Share that URL with your client. That's it.

TO GIVE IT A NICER URL (Optional, Free)
-----------------------------------------
- Create a free Netlify account at netlify.com
- In your dashboard, go to the site settings
- Under "Site information" → "Site name" → change to something like:
  mdm-blog-review.netlify.app

HOW YOUR CLIENT USES IT
-----------------------
1. Client opens the URL — sees the dashboard with all 25 posts listed
2. Clicks any post row to open and read the full content
3. Uses the 3 floating buttons (bottom-right, always visible while scrolling):
     ✓ Approve         → green
     ⚠ Needs Changes   → yellow
     ✕ Reject          → red
4. Can add a written note using the "+ Note" button before approving
5. Dashboard updates automatically — approved/flagged/rejected counts shown in nav
6. When done, clicks "Export Summary" on the dashboard to download
   a plain-text report of all decisions + notes to send back to you

IMPORTANT: APPROVALS ARE STORED IN THE BROWSER
----------------------------------------------
The approval data saves to the client's browser (localStorage).
This means:
  ✓ Works instantly, no login, no backend needed
  ✓ Persists across browser sessions on the same device
  ✗ NOT shared in real time — client exports and emails you the summary
  ✗ If client switches devices, they start fresh

If you want REAL-TIME shared approvals (both of you see live), that requires
a backend service (e.g. Airtable, Notion, or a simple Firebase integration).
Let MDM know if you'd like that upgrade.

UPDATING POSTS
--------------
Posts 3–25 currently show a summary + metadata and point clients to the
full draft document. If you want the full text of all 25 posts embedded
in each page (so it's fully self-contained), the full content can be
added to each post HTML file in the posts/ folder.
